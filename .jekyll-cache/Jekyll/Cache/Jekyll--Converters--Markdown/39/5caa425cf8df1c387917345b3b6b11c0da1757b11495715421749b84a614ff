<p><a href="https://my.vanderbilt.edu/tlwebpage/">Tong Li</a> and I just posted a new
working paper called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06927">Policy Evaluation during a
Pandemic</a>. This is our second paper
about policy evaluation in the context of the pandemic. In the first
paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09605">Evaluating Policies Early in a Pandemic: Bounding Policy Effects
with Nonrandomly Missing Data</a>, we
were mainly interested in dealing with Covid-19 testing being non-random
(as well as different testing rates, etc. across different locations).
In that paper, we ended up proposed a matching estimator, but we got a
lot of comments asking: <em>Why not difference-in-differences?</em></p>

<p>We became quite interested in answering that question. Originally, we
just “had the sense” that DID was not the right tool to use here. But
that has developed into a fully fledged paper now.</p>

<p>And our answer turns out to be the same as before: to us, it seems like
a lot better idea to carefully condition on pre-treatment pandemic
related variables (e.g., number of cases, fraction of the population
still susceptible, population size, and perhaps other variables like
population density or demographics) rather than try to “difference out”
location-specific fixed effects. In other words, we think
unconfoundedness-type identification strategies are likely to be more
appropriate than DID-type identification strategies when it comes to
identifying effects of Covid-19 related policies.</p>

<h2 id="did-or-unconfoundedness-for-evaluating-policies-during-a-pandemic">DID or Unconfoundedness for Evaluating Policies during a Pandemic?</h2>

<p>The key issue is that epidemic models from the epidemiology literature
are highly nonlinear. A leading example is stochastic SIRD model (SIRD
stands for S=Susceptible, I=Infected, R=Recovered, D=Dead). The key
equations in this model look like</p>

\[I_{lt}(0) = (1-\lambda-\gamma)I_{lt-1}(0) + \beta \frac{I_{lt-1}(0)}{N_l} S_{lt-1}(0) + U_{lt}\]

<p>where \(\lambda, \gamma,\) and \(\beta\) are parameters related to the
recovery rate, death rate, and infection rate, respectively; \(N_l\) is
the number of individuals in a particular location, \(U_{lt}\) is an
idiosyncratic shock, and variables indexed by \(\bullet(0)\) are
“potential outcomes” (the values those variables would take if the
policy were not implemented).</p>

<p>You can immediately see that this is a <em>much different</em> model from the
one that would typically lead to difference in differences:</p>

\[I_{lt}(0) = \theta_t + \eta_i + U_{lt}\]

<p>where \(\theta_t\) is a time fixed effect and \(\eta_i\) is an
individual fixed effect.</p>

<p>This shouldn’t be a big surprise either — pandemics are much different
from many of the panel data sorts of applications that we commonly
consider in economics. In particular, the spread of a pandemic is not
really related to a particular location’s “pandemic fixed effect”; this
is much different from, say, applications in labor economics where it
seems much more reasonable to think that an individual’s earnings are
related to their unobserved, time invariant “skill”.</p>

<h2 id="does-the-identification-strategy-actually-matter">Does the identification strategy actually matter?</h2>

<p>The short answer is: yes.</p>

<p>In the paper we consider both simulations related to this and an
application on shelter-in-place orders. Just to keep things short, let’s
just consider the simulations here.</p>

<p>For the simulations, for simplicity, we consider the case where the
policy has no effect on Covid-19 cases (this makes it easy to check if
the approach is working well as we can just check if estimated policy
effects are close to 0). In addition, we consider the case where the
first Covid-19 case tends to show up in treated locations earlier than
for untreated locations.</p>

<p>To start with, here is a plot of what a pandemic looks like in a
stochastic SIRD model. The notation here is the same as above; the
additional variable \(C\) is the cumulative number of cases. The policy
is implemented when \(t=150\), but it has no effect.</p>

<p>Next, is a figure showing estimated effects of the policy on cumulative
Covid-19 cases using DID. Here, we (incorrectly) estimate that the
policy decreased cumulative cases. Basically, treated locations (which
tended to get their first cases earlier) and untreated locations are not
following the same path of untreated potential outcomes due to the
nonlinearity of the model. Interestingly, it is possible to make the
bias positive if you set the timing of the policy differently.</p>

<p><img src="/files/pandemic-policy/did_es_example3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The last figure involves estimating the effect of the policy by
comparing locations that have similar pre-treatment pandemic-related
characteristics (i.e., under unconfoundedness as we suggest doing in the
paper). You can immediately see that this approach works much better.</p>

<h2 id="the-rest-of-the-paper">The Rest of the Paper…</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We propose doubly robust estimators of policy effects. These sorts
of estimators are attractive in this case because they provide
consistent estimates of policy effects if either (i) the propensity
score (which is related to modeling the probability that a location
adopts the policy) or (ii) an outcome regression model (related to
the epidemic model in the absence of the treatment) is correctly
specified. This setup is very attractive here as it gives a way to
evaluate policies while partially circumventing the challenge of
estimating a full pandemic model. Basically, we get to the case
where you need to compare locations that implemented the policy to
locations that didn’t implement the policy (or implemented it later)
conditional on having the same pre-policy characteristics that are
related to the pandemic — economists know a lot about this
setting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also consider the case where a researcher is interested in
understanding the effect of a Covid-19 related policy on an economic
outcome (rather than Covid-19 cases) in the particular case when (i)
the policy can affect the outcome directly, (ii) the policy can
affect the number of Covid-19 cases, and (iii) the number of
Covid-19 cases can have its own effect on the economic outcome. We
show:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Neither standard DID nor including number of cases as a
covariate deliver consistent estimates of ATT-type parameters in
this case.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We propose a way to “adjust” for the policy affecting cases and
deliver a reasonable ATT-type effect of the policy on economic
outcomes.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also have an application about the effects of shelter-in-place
orders on Covid-19 cases and recreational travel. We find that the
results are quite sensitive to which methodological approach one
chooses.</p>
