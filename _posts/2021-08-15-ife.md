    Five Minute Summary: Treatment Effects in Interactive Fixed Effects
    Models

\newcommand{\E}{\mathbb{E}}

[Sonia Karami](https://sites.temple.edu/soniakarami/) and I just posted
a new version of our paper [Treatment Effects in Interactive Fixed
Effects Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15780).

Connection between Difference in Differences and Interactive Fixed Effects Models
=================================================================================

A lot of my research has involved identifying treatment effect
parameters in a difference in differences (DID) framework. For DID, the
main identifying assumption is the parallel trends assumption:

**Parallel Trends Assumption** $$
    \mathbb{E}[\Delta Y_t(0) | D=1] = \mathbb{E}[\Delta Y_t(0) | D=0]
$$

Parallel trends assumptions are very closely related to the following
model for untreated potential outcomes:

$$
    Y_{it}(0) = \theta_t + \eta_i + U_{it}
$$ where $\theta_t$ is a time fixed effect, $\eta_i$ is an individual
fixed effect, and $U_{it}$ are idiosyncratic time varying unobservables.
