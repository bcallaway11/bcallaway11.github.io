Introduction
------------

One of the main ways that researchers use our `did` package is to plot
event studies. These are quite useful in order to think about (i)
dynamic effects of participating in the treatment and (ii) to "pre-test"
the parallel trends assumption.

You can find an extended discussion about event studies, limitations of
event study regressions in a number of relevant cases, etc.
[here](https://bcallaway11.github.io/did/articles/TWFE.html).

This post isn't about criticizing event study regressions; instead, what
I want to talk about is the choice of the "base period" in event
studies.

Types of Base Periods
---------------------

Event study regressions typically have a **universal base period**. This
means that all differences are relative to a particular period, and,
most commonly, it is set to be the period immediately before the
treatment starts.

In the `did` package, our default is to use a **varying base period**.
In pre-treatment periods, the base period is the immediately preceding
period; e.g., if period 4 is pre-treatment, then the base period for
this period will be period 3.

If there are violations of parallel trends in pre-treatment periods,
then the interpretation of reported "effects" in pre-treatment periods
in an event study differs depending on whether one uses a varying or
universal base period. Here is the difference:

-   With a varying base period, the reported effects are
    **pseudo-ATTs**. They are what we would have estimated effect of
    participating in the treatment to be (on impact) if the treatment
    had occurred in that period (instead of when it actually occurred).

-   With a universal base period, event study estimates in pre-treatment
    periods are not themselves treatment effect parameters, but they are
    useful for showing how outcomes are trending over time.

In the newest version (version 2.1) of `did`, we have added a new
argument, `base_period`, to `att_gt` to give users the option to choose
either a `varying` (the default) or `universal` base period.

A couple of other things that are also worth mentioning:

-   In post-treatment periods, the base period is the period immediately
    before treatment both cases $$\implies$$ the only place where this
    difference matters is in pre-treatment periods.

-   In pre-treatment periods, either case is just a linear combination
    of the other, so they essentially are just alternative ways of
    reporting the same information. That is, choosing between a varying
    or universal base period is more related to how to the "style" of
    presenting results and shouldn't change conclusions about whether
    parallel trends is violated in pre-treatment periods, etc.

Comments/Opinions
-----------------

My sense is that providing results using a varying base period tends to
work better when (i) the researcher is primarily concerned with
treatment effect anticipation, and/or (ii) the number of pre-treatment
periods is relatively small. And that using a universal base period
tends to work better when (i) the researcher thinks that there are
long-term differences in trends across groups, and/or (ii) the number of
pre-treatment periods is relatively large.

Finally, although using a universal based period is relatively more
common in applications, it seems to me that this is mainly because it is
easier to implement this when you are running an event study regression.
For researchers that are directly computing averages of paths of
outcomes at different lengths of exposure to the treatment (as we do in
the `did` package), reporting the results in using either type of base
period is easy to do.

Some Examples
-------------

**Example 1: No violations of parallel trends**

Let's start with the simplest case where there are no violations of
parallel trends in pre-treatment periods.

``` {.r}
library(did) # need to load version 2.1 of package
```

Below is some code to generate data where parallel trends holds in all
periods, and the average effect of participating in the treatment is
equal to 1 (`reset.sim` and `build_sim_dataset` are functions in the
`did` package for generating simulated data).

``` {.r}
# create data with no pre-trends
time.periods <- 5
sp <- reset.sim(time.periods=time.periods)
sp$te <- 1
data <- build_sim_dataset(sp)
data <- subset(data, G==time.periods | G==0)

# varying base period
res1_varying <- att_gt(yname="Y", xformla=~X, data=data, tname="period",
              idname="id",
              control_group="nevertreated",
              gname="G", est_method="dr")
dynamic1_varying <- aggte(res1_varying, type="dynamic")
p1_varying <- ggdid(dynamic1_varying, ylim=c(-2,2))

# universal base period
res1_universal <- att_gt(yname="Y", xformla=~X, data=data, tname="period",
              idname="id",
              control_group="nevertreated",
              gname="G", est_method="dr", base_period="universal"
              )
dynamic1_universal <- aggte(res1_universal, type="dynamic")
p1_universal <- ggdid(dynamic1_universal, ylim=c(-2,2))

ggpubr::ggarrange(p1_varying, p1_universal, nrow=1)
```

The plot on the left uses a varying base period while the plot on the
right uses a universal base period. The estimated treatment effects when
$$e=0$$ are numerically identical. The pre-treatment estimates are not
numerically identical (they are based on different paths of outcomes in
pre-treatment periods for the treated group relative to the untreated
group), but (as expected) neither provides any evidence against parallel
trends. Finally, notice that using a varying base period provides an
estimate when $$e=0$$, but does not provide an estimate when $$e=-4$$;
using a universal base period provides an estimate when $$e=-4$$ but not
when $$e=-1$$.

**Example 2: Anticipation Effects**

Next, we generate data where there anticipation effects. What is
happening here is that there is a group that becomes treated in the last
period and a group that never participates in the treatment (in order to
not clutter the post with code, let me just point you to the [complete
code for this
post](/files/2021-11-09-event_study_universal_v_local_base_period.R)...it
is very similar to the code above). Parallel trends holds in all periods
except the period right before treatment when the treated group
experiences a negative "anticipation" effect of participating in the
treatment.

<img src="/files/figures/event-study-universal-v-varying-base-period/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

As before, the results using a varying base period are in the panel on
the left, and the results using a universal base period are on the
right. As before, the post-treatment estimated effects are exactly the
same. To me, it seems much clearer to interpret the figure on the left
(recall that there are anticipation effects that are equal to -1 in the
pre-treatment period). For me, the figure on the right is hard to
interpret.

**Example 3: Longer Run Linear Trends**

Finally, let's consider the case where there are longish-run linear
trend differences between the treated group and untreated group (and,
thus, parallel trends is violated in pre-treatment periods). That is, we
are in the case where, on average, outcomes are increasing by one in the
treated group relative to the untreated group across all periods (both
pre-treatment and post-treatment).

<img src="/files/figures/event-study-universal-v-varying-base-period/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

As in the earlier two cases, the panel on the left contains results
using a varying base period, and the panel on the right contains results
using a universal base period; likewise, the post-treatment estimates
are numerically identical. In this case, to me, it seems easier to
notice the linear difference in trends in the right panel. If you are
careful, you can still interpret the results using a varying base
period. Particularly, in every pre-treatment period, we would have
over-estimated the effect of participating in the treatment (if the
treatment had started in that period) -- this happpens because of the
linear violations of parallel trends in all periods.
