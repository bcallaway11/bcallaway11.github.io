The R `qte` package provides many methods for estimating the Quantile Treatment Effect (QTE) or the Quantile Treatment Effect on the Treated (QTET). These include estimating the QTE and QTET under the assumption of selection on observables (Firpo, 2007), the QTET in the Changes in Changes model (Athey and Imbens, 2006), the QTET in the Quantile Difference in Differences model, and the QTET under a Distributional Difference in Differences assumption (Callaway and Li, 2015).
